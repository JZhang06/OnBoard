# OnBoard

OnBoard is a unique task management platform, designed by and made for healthcare professionals.

The delivery of healthcare within the hospital involves a variety of healthcare professionals.
For 1 patient, the average hospital stay is 7 days and involves 18 different healthcare workers.

Patient care is complex, and with complex cases, come complex tasks. 

OnBoard streamlines task delegation before, during, and after rounds, can be integrated with the EHR system, and provides a seamless transition into the hospital workflow.

OnBoard allows healthcare professionals to increase efficiency, reduce redundancy within the workflow, and follows the patient's journey in their care.
